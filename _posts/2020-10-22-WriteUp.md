## Birthday Problem 

### Theoretical 

Given that P(A) = Birthday on 1st Jan and P(B) = Birthday on 1st Jan and given:

We hence get the probability that for two people, both having the same birthday is:

which = 1/365. 

However, the issue with this approach is that it quickly becomes difficult to manage when we consider three persons since we would need to consider the probability of A and B having the same birthday, then B and C having the same birthday, A and C having the same birthday, as well as A and B and C having the same birthday. This would still be relatively manageable but would be difficult to scale up to *n* people. Thankfully, probabilities work in that they add up to 1. Hence if P(X) were the probability that at least 2 had the same birthday, P(X') would be the probability that no 2 had the same birthday, which would be easily calculated for *n* persons as:

and P(X) could be obtained by 1 - P(X'). 

### R Approach

```R
set.seed(2210)

run_no <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "How many simulation runs: "))
people_no <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "How many people: "))

birth_match = 0

for (i in 1:run_no){
  birthday <- sample(1:365, people_no, replace = TRUE)
  birthday_wo <- unique(birthday)
  if (length(birthday) == length(birthday_wo)){
    birth_match = birth_match
  } else if (length(birthday) > length(birthday_wo)){
    birth_match = birth_match + 1
  }
}

prob = birth_match/run_no
print(prob)
```

```
How many simulation runs: 10000
How many people: 300
## [1] 0.5051
```

And if we were to graph out the probabilities of there being at least 2 or more individuals with the same birthday over 300 individuals:

```R
for (z in 2:people_no-1){
  for (i in 1:run_no){
    birthday <- sample(1:365, z, replace = TRUE)
    birthday_wo <- unique(birthday)
    if (length(birthday) == length(birthday_wo)){
      birth_match = birth_match
    } else if (length(birthday) > length(birthday_wo)){
      birth_match = birth_match + 1
    }
    prob_match = birth_match/run_no
  }
  birth_match = 0
  z = z + 1
  prob <- rbind(prob,list(z, prob_match))
}

plot <- ggplot(prob, aes(x=X2,y=X0)) + geom_point() + geom_line(linetype="solid",color="red",size=1) +
  labs(x = "Number of People", y = "Probability") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d()

plot
```

The interesting finding from this is that the probability reaches 0.5 fairly quickly, unlike what one would intuitively expect (i.e. the probability reaching 0.5 only at 365/2~183)

## Monty Hall Problem

### Theoretical

For the theoretical approach, I genuinely could not think of way to explain it on my own because it really is such a counterintuitive problem. I found [Volokh's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/03/02/an-easy-answer-to-the-infamous-monty-hall-problem/) explanation the easiest to understand. However, on my own, I was unable to come up with a proper probabilistic explanation. I also turned to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem#Direct_calculation) for a solution (sorry) and found that the Direct Calculation method (riding on Bayes' rule) also made a lot of sense. 

### R Approach

Using R, there are numerous examples that I came across while trying to understand the analytical background of the problem. I initially used replicate to find the probabilities for not switching. However, I also found a really useful `setdiff` function and tried it for the switching probability: 

```R
#if stay
n <- 10000
correct_door <- replicate(n,sample(1:3,1))
my_pick <- replicate(n,sample(1:3,1))
prob_stay <- length(which(correct_door==my_pick))/n
prob_stay
```
```
## [1] 0.3373
```

```R
#if switch
switch_right <- 0
for (i in 1:n){
  correct_door <- sample(1:3,1)
  my_pick <- sample(1:3,1)
  if (correct_door != my_pick){
    show_door <- setdiff(1:3,c(my_pick,correct_door))
    new_pick <- correct_door
  }
  else {
    show_door = sample((setdiff(1:3,my_pick)),1)
    new_pick = setdiff(1:3,c(my_pick,show_door))
  } 
  if (new_pick == correct_door){
    switch_right <- switch_right + 1
  }
  else {
    switch_right <- switch_right
  }
}
prob_switch <- switch_right/n
prob_switch
```

 ```
## [1] 0.6709
 ```

This therefore shows that it makes sense to switch given the higher probability. I also wondered what happened if we were to increase the number of doors. The above code can be easily modified to allow for *n* number of doors:

```R
#if switch
t <- 1000
switch_right <- 0
for (i in 1:n){
  correct_door <- sample(1:t,1)
  my_pick <- sample(1:t,1)
  if (correct_door != my_pick){
    show_door <- setdiff(1:t,c(my_pick,correct_door))
    new_pick <- correct_door
    } else if (correct_door == my_pick){
    show_door = sample(setdiff(1:t,c(my_pick)),(t-2))
    new_pick = sample((setdiff(1:t,c(correct_door,show_door))),1)
  } 
  if (new_pick == correct_door){
    switch_right <- switch_right + 1
  }  else {
    switch_right <- switch_right
  }
}
prob_switch <- switch_right/n
prob_switch
```

```
## [1] 0.9992
```

With 1000 doors, the probability that one would win switching goes up to 0.9992. I guess even analytically, this might be a way to confront the problem - thinking about it with 1000 doors (which makes more sense), and then progressively removing the number of doors until you come down to three doors. I also thought it would be interesting to plot out the probabilities of this for 3 doors all the way to 1000 doors:

```R
#if switch

doors.prob <- data.frame()

max_doors <- 1000

for (t in 3:max_doors){
  switch_right <- 0
  for (i in 1:n){
    correct_door <- sample(1:t,1)
    my_pick <- sample(1:t,1)
    if (correct_door != my_pick){
      show_door <- setdiff(1:t,c(my_pick,correct_door))
      new_pick <- correct_door
    } else if (correct_door == my_pick){
      show_door = sample(setdiff(1:t,c(my_pick)),(t-2))
      new_pick = sample((setdiff(1:t,c(correct_door,show_door))),1)
    } 
    if (new_pick == correct_door){
      switch_right <- switch_right + 1
    }  else {
      switch_right <- switch_right
    }
    prob_switch <- switch_right/n
  }
  switch_right <- 0 
  t = t + 1
  doors.prob <- rbind(doors.prob, list(t,prob_switch))
}

plot <- ggplot(doors.prob, aes(x=X4,y=X0.724)) + geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Number of doors", y = "Probability") + # Axis labels
  scale_fill_viridis_d()
```
