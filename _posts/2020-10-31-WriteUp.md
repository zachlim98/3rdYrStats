## Part A

```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
hist(runif(10))
```

```R
hist(runif(100))
```

```R
hist(runif(100000))
```

1. As _n_ increases, the frequency of each value occurring begins to equalize. We see that with a larger *n*, the probability of each variable becomes uniform. This informs us that in a Uniform distribution, there is an equal likelihood of events within the sample space *S* occurring.
2. Using the default values of `dunif(min=0,max=1)`, we see that it affects the density distribution for values -1 to 2, with all values between 0 and 1 have a 1.0 probability of occurring. 
3. This suggests that for P(X=0.37629) (as illustrated by the blue line), the value is also **1.0**

```R
x_var <- (seq(-1, 2, by = 0.01))
y_var <- dunif(x_var,min=0,max=1)
y_varr <- bind_cols(y_var,x_var)

plot <- ggplot(data=y_varr, aes(x=...2,y=...1)) + geom_point() + 
  labs(y = "Probability", x = "Seq of numbers") + 
  geom_segment(aes(x=0.37629,y=0,xend=0.37629,yend=1.0), color = "blue", size=1.5)
```

## Part B

```R
vote <- sample(c(1,0),100,replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.7,0.3))
hist(vote, main="Histogram from Sample function", xlab = "Voted")
```

```R
vote_bi <- rbinom(100, 1, 0.7)
hist(vote_bi, main="Histogram from rbinom function", xlab = "Voted")
```

```R
total_vote <- sum(vote==1)
total_vote_bi <- sum(vote_bi==1)
cat("People who voted: ", total_vote)
cat("People who voted (rbinom): ", total_vote_bi)
```

```
## People who voted: 79
## People who voted (rbinom): 60
```
1. Using the `sample` function, the number of people who voted is 79. 
2. Using `rbinom`, the number of people who voted is 60. A Bernoulli random variable and Binomial random variable are similar in that there are only 2 possible outcomes for each (vote/don't vote). Given that for a Bernoulli random variable there is only one parameter of *p* = **P**(*X*=1) and that for a Binomial random variable, there is an additional variable of no. of trials per random variable, it stands to reason that a Binomial random variable is generated from Bernoulli random variables begin run across *n* number of samples. 

```R 
rbinom(100,1,0.7)
rbinom(1,100,0.7)
```

``` 
##  [1] 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1
## [38] 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
## [75] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1

## [1] 68
```
3. `rbinom(100,1,0.7)` returns 100 integers of either 1 or 0, with 60 having a value of 1. In probability theory, each random variable has P(X=1) = 0.7 and this is repeated once across a 100 variables. With regards to the example, this would be if one were to ask a 100 people **once**, with each ask having a probability of success of 0.7. 60 people would agree to vote. 

   `rbinom(1,100,0.7)` returns the value `68`. In probability theory, this suggests similarly that P(X=1) = 0.7 but this is repeated a 100 times on a single random variable. With regards to the example, this would be if one were to ask **only ONE person** a 100 times with each time you ask having a probability of success of 0.7. The person would agree to vote 68 times. 

## Part C

```R
prob_pand <- dpois(4,1)
cat("Probability of 4 Pandemics in a decade: ", prob_pand)
```

```
## Probability of 4 Pandemics in a decade: 0.01532831
```

```R
plot(dpois(seq(0,20,1),1),xlim = c(0,20), ylim = c(0.0,0.5),xaxt="n")
axis(1,at=seq(1,10,1), las = 1)
```

```R
for (i in c(3,7,10)){
  plot(dpois(seq(0,20,1),i))
 }
```

3. As **lambda** increases, the Poisson distribution more closely resembles a normal distribution with a symmetrical shape (as opposed to a right skewed shape at smaller lambda values)
