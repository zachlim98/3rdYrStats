Problem Sheet 2
===============

Problem Set A
-------------

1. Created a function to simulate the betting game

```R
library(dplyr)
set.seed(281020) #set seed for simulation

walk <- function(S=0, K=10){
  round_amt <- c() #create list to store sequence of bets
  while (abs(S) < abs(K)){
    choice <- sample(c(1,2),1,prob=c(0.49,0.51)) #choose win or loose
    if (choice == 1){ #if win
      S <- S + 1
      round_amt <- c(round_amt,S)
      } else { #if lose
        S <- S - 1
        round_amt <- c(round_amt,S)
      }
    }
  return(round_amt) #return list
}
```
3. Used the replicate function to simulate the game being played 10 times and added it to the `walks` data frame. 

```R
total_sim <- replicate(10,temp <- tibble(walk())) #create list of lists of outcomes

walks <- data_frame() #create empty data
for (i in 1:10){
  df <- data.frame(matrix(unlist(total_sim[i]), #unbind lists from lists 
                          nrow=length(total_sim[i]), byrow=T)) #add to dataframe by row 
  walks <- bind_rows(walks,df)
}
```
4. Added the game number (so that we can group it later in the plot) to the data frame. Following which, pivoted it to a long data frame for ease of plotting. Added labels to the ends of the outcomes to make it clearer for viewers to understand what each outcome meant

```R
game_names <- data.frame("game" = 1:10) #df to store game number
walks <- cbind(game_names,walks) #add game number to df
walks <- walks %>% pivot_longer(!game,names_to="Game",values_to="Money")  %>%
   mutate(Round=as.integer(gsub("X","",Game))) #pivot from rows to columns

#create plot
plot <- walks %>% ggplot(aes(x=Round,y=Money,group=factor(game),color=factor(game))) +
  geom_line(size=1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-10,10,1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,220,10)) +
  labs(title="Outcome of 10 Games",x="No. of bets",y="Money",color="Game Number") +
  annotate("label", x = c(52,57,130,170), y = 10.5, label="win") +
  annotate("label", x = c(60,90,120,132,138,210), y = -10.5, label="lose") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_bw() 
```

5. Edited the function to capture just winning and losing 

```R
#create function to just capture win/loss
walk_win <- function(S=0, K=10){
  while (abs(S) < abs(K)){
    choice <- sample(c(1,2),1,prob=c(0.49,0.51))
    if (choice == 1){
      S <- S + 1
    } else {
      S <- S - 1
    }
  }
  return(S)
}

#simulate 10,000 games, record win/loss
r<-100000
wins <- 0
for (i in 1:r){
  outcome <- walk_win()
  if (outcome > 0){
    wins <- wins + 1
  }
}

prob_win <- wins/r #probability of winning
prob_win
```
```
##[1] 0.39821
```
6. For this question, I struggled for awhile wondering how to handle the conditional probability. I then realised that the conditional probability could be embedded within the function since S would be "-3" given that you lost the first 3 bets

```R
#find prob of winning given lost first three bets
win_lost3 <- function(S=-3, K=10){
  while (abs(S) < abs(K)){
    choice <- sample(c(1,2),1,prob=c(0.49,0.51))
    if (choice == 1){
      S <- S + 1
    } else {
      S <- S - 1
    }
  }
  return(S)
}

#simulate 100,000 times
r<-100000
wins3 <- 0
for (i in 1:r){
  outcome <- win_lost3()
  if (outcome > 0){
    wins3 <- wins3 + 1
  }
}

prob_win3 <- wins3/r #probability of winning given lost first 3
prob_win3
```
```
##[1] 0.2633
```
Problem Set B
-------------

1. Since there are 0-9 values, it means that there are 10 digits available for each rotor. Therefore:

```R
Passcodes <- 10**5 #number of combinations 
Passcodes
```

```
##[1] 1e+05
```

2. This was a bit trickier. I initially wanted to do 26 choose 2 to simulate choosing just 2 but then I realised that it would be easier to just choose 13 and then match that to all the other half of alphabets. (I would use this realization later to generate the plugboard configuration). Then divide by 2^13 because for each pair, we want to divide by 2 because A-B and B-A are the same.

 ```R
PB_config <- choose(26,13)*factorial(13)/2**13 #number of plugboard configs
PB_config
 ```
```
##[1] 7.905854e+12
```

3. The total number of possible settings would then be the multiplication of the two sets of combinations.

``` R
Poss_set <- Passcodes*PB_config #total number of configs
Poss_set
```

```
##[1] 7.905854e+17
```

4. This question would be solved using Bayes' Rule and the Law of Total Probability. Using the Law of Total Probability, I found P(Failure) and then used Bayes' Rule to get P(Machine | Failure) from P(Failure | Machine). 

```R
prob_A <- 300/1000
prob_B <- 500/1000
prob_C <- 200/1000
prob_f_givA <- 0.09
prob_f_givB <- 0.04
prob_f_givC <- 0.11

prob_f <- (prob_A*prob_f_givA) + (prob_B*prob_f_givB) + (prob_C*prob_f_givC)

prob_A_givf <- (prob_A*prob_f_givA)/prob_f
prob_B_givf <- (prob_B*prob_f_givB)/prob_f
prob_C_givf <- (prob_C*prob_f_givC)/prob_f
prob_A_givf
prob_B_givf
prob_C_givf
```

```
##[1] 0.3913043
##[1] 0.2898551
##[1] 0.3188406
```

â€‹	Looking at the probabilities, it is hence likely that the failure came from Machine A

5. As per the thinking in question 2, I first chose 13 and then sampled the other 13 and then joined them to form a matrix. 

```R
sample1 <- sample(letters, 13) #choose 13 random letters
sample2 <- sample(setdiff(letters,sample1),13) #shuffle the other 13 random
samples <- append(sample1,sample2)
config <- matrix(samples, nrow = 13) #create 2 columns of letters
```

6. I wanted to make this a fully formed enigma machine (haha) that could allow one to generate new plugboard configurations again and again. I hence first created a function to generate new codes (using the set.seed function) or input previously set plugboards configurations

```R
#function to allow allies to generate new plugboard config
new_code <- function(){
  seed <- readline(prompt = "Choose the seed for the configuration: ")
  #set.seed to allow for different config to be generated
  set.seed(seed)
  #generate new key-pair value
  sample1 <- sample(letters, 13) 
  sample2 <- sample(setdiff(letters,sample1),13) 
  sets1 <- append(sample1,sample2)
  sets2 <- append(sample2,sample1)
  names(sets1) <- sets2
  return(sets1)
}
```

Following which, I wrote a function to check for only letters. This is to ensure that no errors occurred during the process of encryption/decryption. 

```R
#function to check that message typed in is only alphabets
letters_only <- function(x) !grepl("[^A-Za-z ]", x)
```

I then created a function that would prompt for a new message and then prepare the entered message to be encrypted/decrypted by splitting up the strings to individual characters. Also some basic error handling should the user not type in a message with only alphabets.

```R
#function to prompt user to enter new message
enter_message <- function(){
  message <- readline(prompt="What is your message: ")
  if (letters_only(message)==T){ #check if messages are alphabets
    store <- strsplit(tolower(message),split="") #split and convert to lower letters
  } else{
    print("ERROR: Please type in only letters") #error msg if disallowed entry
  }
  return(store)
}
```

And finally the function itself. I combined the other two functions:

```R
#function to encode and decode
enigma <- function(){
  cyp <- new_code()
  new_msg <- enter_message() #prompt for new message
  decode <- c()
  for (i in new_msg){
    char <- cyp[i] #access PB config
    decode <- append(decode,char) #add to encoded/decoded character list
  }
  readable <- gsub("NA"," ",paste(decode, collapse = "")) #make it easier to read
  cat("Your message is: ",readable) #print out the encoded/decoded message
}
```

And testing it out...

```
enigma()
###[1] Choose the seed for the configuration: 43
###[2] What is your message: the war is over
###[3] Your message is:  lpk sdq bw zxkq
```

And then decoding it...

```
enigma()
###[1] Choose the seed for the configuration: 43
###[2] What is your message: lpk sdq bw zxkq
###[3] Your message is:  the war is over
```
